        <p1>Julley Skarma.<br> This is just a small creation from me to you. I know there's nothing much happened between us which can make any significant meaning of making this type of present for you. Consider this as a return gift to you for what you did at my birthday. Which is, I was alone and u made my day special by giving me a long conversation after a long time. That's where you represented yourself as the kindest person of all timeðŸ¤˜, Even been bored by my stories and talks, you kept making the other's happy around you. 
<br>
Well I don't know how much I can go further by talking just about you, so I just wanted to say how I feel you are and you must be in your life: 
<br>
"U think ur life is boring n empty but see there are not many people who can be featured to have a bdy gift like this: 
<br>
"U are amazing and enjoy things in ur own way and there're some people who likes u the way you are."
<br>
"Atleast you have travelled the whole vertical path of India whereas I've been only few or less, that makes you the happier above me"
<br>
"If you still think that your life is empty and have no motive of your own existence feel free to remember what I've said to you all the way till now in this web page"</p1>
<p>I wish we can meet sometime somewhere somehow at someplace if possible, I'll be always waiting for your call of whatever you demand me for.</p>
